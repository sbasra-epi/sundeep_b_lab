Welcome to sundeep_b_lab — my personal development lab and home for a wide-ranging collection of code experiments, utilities, learning projects, and technical explorations.
This repository isn’t a single project. It’s a living workspace where I:
- Explore new programming concepts
- Build small tools and scripts
- Prototype ideas before turning them into full projects
- Store reference implementations and reusable snippets
- Document patterns, workflows, and techniques I want to revisit
Think of it as a digital lab notebook: organized enough to navigate, flexible enough to grow, and open-ended enough to support whatever I’m curious about next.
